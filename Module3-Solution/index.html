      <h3 class="menu-title text-center">Chicken</h3>
      <p class="menu-details">
      Chickens are domestic or farm birds. The live span of a chicken is about 10 to 15 years. The male is larger and more brightly colored than the female. This is common feature in birds. The males show off their colorful feathers to attract the females.A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck. The male has a larger comb compared to the female. The male is called a rooster. The female is called a hen while the young are called chicks.Chicken is a type of poultry that is high in protein and, when eaten without the skin, quite lean. Skinless white meat chicken breast is the lowest in fat and calories. Chicken is rich in many vitamins and minerals essential for human health and is a good food choice for dieters as well as bodybuilders and everyone in-between.Chicken is a carbohydrate-free food. According to NutritionData, skinless chicken breast provides the least amount of calories and fat, about 143 calories, 3g total fat and 1g saturated fat for half of a large boneless, skinless breast, or a 95g serving. Dark meat is higher in fat. About 86g of dark meat without skin provides 165 calories and 8g total fat, 2g of which are saturated. This nutrition information is for chicken that has been stewed without added fat.Like beef, fish and other types of poultry, chicken is high in protein. Each ounce of meat provides 7g protein. A typical portion is about 4 ounces or the size of a deck of cards and provides 28g protein. Also, like all animal protein foods and soy products, chicken is a complete protein food, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. Protein has many functions in the human body, including building body tissues and muscles.Chicken is a rich source of two B vitamins: niacin or vitamin B3 and vitamin B6. A 4-ounce portion meets 40 and 16 percent respectively of the recommended daily value, or DV. The most important function of niacin is in helping to release energy from carbohydrates. It also aids in the formation of red blood cells. The best food source of vitamin B6 is poultry. This nutrient performs the same functions as niacin but is also important for protein metabolism, is necessary for proper immune system function and helps produce certain neurotransmitters, or brain chemicals.How chicken is prepared and/or ingredients added alters the nutrition facts. For example, deep frying chicken and/or consuming the skin increases the amount of fat significantly. Breading chicken or coating it in flour adds carbohydrates. While minerals are indestructible, vitamins are easily destroyed by heat, light and other conditions. Boiling chicken in water may leach the B vitamins. Dry heat cooking methods, such as broiling, may better retain these nutrients.One of the eight cuisines of China, Hunan cuisine is known for its hot and spicy food. Chilies are used liberally, and it is the spiciest of all Chinese cuisines. Raw hotness is the specialty of this region. General Tso's chicken, a hot and sour Hunanese dish, is very popular. Boneless, skinless chicken is cut into medium chunks and deep-fried in oil. They are then are sautéed with vegetables and coated with a sweet and sour sauce. The sauce is made of soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, tomato paste, chicken broth, onion, cornflour, sugar, and salt. The dish is usually garnished with crisp pepper or spring onions. It is a savory and spicy mouth-watering dish, which is usually served hot with rice.</p>

      <h3 class="menu-title text-center">Beef</h3>
      <p class="menu-details">By building a science-based knowledge foundation, research is the cornerstone of all checkoff-funded marketing, promotion, education and information programs. The Human Nutrition, Product Quality, Safety, and Sustainability research programs are contained in the Science &amp; Product Solutions Department at National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA), a contractor to the beef checkoff. Market Research is conducted as part of NCBA’s Market Research &amp; Planning Department. It is categorized as red meat, a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.Fresh lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc, and is therefore recommended as part of a healthy diet.Grass feeding is a practice not yet familiar to all consumers. 100% grass-fed beef comes from cows who have grazed in pasture year-round rather than being fed a processed diet for much of their life. Grass feeding improves the quality of beef, and makes the beef richer in omega-3 fats, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and CLA (a beneficial fatty acid named conjugated linoleic acid.One thing you'll notice about the chart above is an absence of recommendations about specific cuts of beef. In general, we recommend sticking with lower fat cuts of beef if you decide to include this food in your meal plan. Lower fat cuts include top round, bottom round, eye of round, flank, and strip. Health organizations have traditionally recommended avoidance of higher fat cuts like tenderloin, ribeye, or porterhouse because it can be difficult to make room for the amount of total fat, saturated fat, and calories they contain. Since too much total fat, too much saturated fat, and too many calories in a daily meal plan can raise the risk of certain health problems, this approach makes sense to us, particularly in light of the fact that lower fat beef cut can still provide you with the nutritional benefits of 100% grass-fed beef in terms of omega-3s, CLA, beta-carotene, and vitamin E. </p>

      <h3 class="menu-title text-center">Sushi</h3>
      <p class="menu-details">The word “sushi” actually refers to rice that has been seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, and contrary to popular belief, Sushi does not mean raw fish at all.Raw fish sliced and served by itself is called sashimi.Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan, and one of the most popular dishes among the Japanese themselves. In Japan, sushi is usually enjoyed on special occasions, such as a celebration.Good sushi rice is somewhat chewy, and sticky to the touch.Sushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, in one or two bites, although many people use chopsticks.It is not considered polite to pass food from one person to another using chopsticks, as this parallels a Japanese funeral ceremony.While there are obviously a few calories to be found in rice and eggs, there are a number of variations when it comes to sushi that you can take advantage of. For example, sashimi is raw fish pieces that come without rice, and they are very nutritious and low in calories. Here is a look at some of the benefits of sushi and how you can go about enjoying it without having to worry about packing on the pounds.While it is true that sushi can be a healthy meal and low cal option, there are heavy differences in many of the types and styles of sushi you can indulge in.Certain restaurants that prefer flavor over nutrition may opt to dump mayonnaise and salt into their sushi, upping the calorie count without you even realizing. With that said, here is some nutritional information that can give you an idea of the nutrients and amount of calories that come with certain types of sushi (on a per roll basis):
      It is important to note that it is the certain extra add-ons that can make certain types of sushi unhealthy. The extra mayonnaise in tuna rolls have a big effect on their calorie count. Also try not to be confused by the fancy word, "tempura". Tempura is just a tricky way of saying that the sushi roll is fried, and we all know that we should try and steer clear of fried foods when trying to lose weight.</p>
