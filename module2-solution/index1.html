      <h2 id="sushi">Sushi</h2>
      <p>The word “sushi” actually refers to rice that has been seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, and contrary to popular belief, Sushi does not mean raw fish at all.Raw fish sliced and served by itself is called sashimi.Good sushi rice is somewhat chewy, and sticky to the touch.Sushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, in one or two bites, although many people use chopsticks.It is not considered polite to pass food from one person to another using chopsticks, as this parallels a Japanese funeral ceremony. </p>
