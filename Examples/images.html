In the current scenario of text classification most of the researchers have focused towards different machine learning approaches. Language Identification(LID) is defined as the task of identifying the language from a given document. Language identification is an important problem in Natural Language Processing. Language identification is of special significance for a multi-lingual country like India, where multiple languages share a single script. Language identification has traditionally been approached using character-level n-gram language models. In this project we propose the use of Random forest algorithm for the task of language identification. &quoat;
