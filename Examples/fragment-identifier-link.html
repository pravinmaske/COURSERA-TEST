				The problem of language identification first attracted the attention of researchers in&nbsp;he
early seventies, and in the past three decades this problem has been addressed by several
researchers in many different ways. In the current scenario of text classification most of
the researchers have focused towards different machine learning approaches. Language
Identification(LID) is defined as the task of identifying the language from a given
document. Language identification is an important problem in Natural Language
Processing. Language identification is of special significance for a multi-lingual
country like India, where multiple languages share a single script. Language
identification has traditionally been approached
using character-level n-gram language
models. In this project we propose the use of Random forest algorithm for the task
of language identification. The Random forest Algorithm is generally more accurate as a
classifier. Random forest is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision trees
and outputs the class that is the mode of the class‘s output by individual trees. The
method combines Breiman's "bagging" idea and the random selection of features.
