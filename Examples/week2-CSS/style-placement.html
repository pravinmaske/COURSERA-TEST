<h1>Style placement.!! </h1>
<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<p>Hey guys this is pravin and today am going to  tell about CSS style placements basically the style placement is used to achive reusability purpose. We can specify style directly with tag element but this is the least used method. It is always better to use css style by specifying the style tag under head tag. So If our website has severel web-pages and if we want same style for every page then there "External stylesheet" is used. Basically in External stylesheet we create seperate css file and write all the stylesheet code into this file and link that file to the original html page.</p>
